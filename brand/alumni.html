<p>I never knew that becoming a part of the GLA Fraternity will be such a blessing in my life. In the year 2013 I joined this prestigious Institution knowing nothing about my hidden capabilities and strengths. 
<br>
Well thanks to almighty, I was in good hands!
<br>
Having no exposure at all in anything to organizing events was a whole journey in itself. It took me almost a year to imbibe into the challenging atmosphere and enriched culture. Then, I started participating in the events and gradually got a hang of everything. From initially participating to driving a whole event by being the Anchor was a great achievement I would say. 
<br>
But I believe in dreaming, and dreaming Big. With all the knowledge and expertise I had and with the help and experience of all my seniors, I established "Literario".
<br>
Finally with all things said and done, and the challenges that came my way, with the right attitude I turned them into stepping stones and at last it was time to mark the starting of a Revolution: Brij Literature Festival.
As, I have been referring BLF as a dream it would not have been successful without the able guidance of Anoop Sir.
<br>
Thanks to the experience gained from Literario, because of which I am lauded with more than 6 organizational level awards in Tech Mahindra Ltd. in less than 2 years of my services rendered.
<br>
I hope to bring more glory and respect to the institutions I am associated with on my way going forward. 
<br>
Perseverance, Intellect and Confidence has always been the key.

<p>4th of August 2014 I entered the University. I was quite introvert, shy and very ugly(remember this).
I was the kind of guy who won't open up easily who will only be comfortable with a group of people.
Two years passed by like this I put all my efforts in learning web development. One fine evening a gentleman named pranao sinha knocks my door and asks want to work in TEDxGLAU to be a part of a web development team and after that, it was all a joyride from developing websites to working on the field from following orders to giving orders from being in a team to leading the team I found myself as the President of one of the big clubs' literario that's what we called ourselves. Then on 15 May 2018 I left the university as a confident and smart person but I was still ugly... <br>
I gained too much and I lost too much in my college days I learned too much and I forgot too much but one thing I did not do was that I did not settle for less. So here I am today working in a leading bank as a developer and following my passion as a stand-up comedian but yeah I am still ugly...</p>

Sir, you have been continuous support for each one of us. All your lessons about life will remain with us and values forever. Not only this, you even taught us to respect our relations.

And soon I will be joining Accenture as a Full Stack Engineer. Throughout my engineering I've developed a handful of Android and Desktop apps, one is very famous at the campus, named, GLAU FireAuth.

Apart from this, I was also a part of Literario, GLAU and played the role of Associate Designer and the Public Relations team as well. The team at Literario is full of energetic people and always thrives to grow and do better, and the mentors multiply the potential through their support. Being a part of such a family is a bliss.
